Notes for saving game:
    Serialization is buggy with listeners, in this case enemy death listeners. We will need to refactor this to save game properly.
    There may be other issues with serialization as well 

Actions happen simulatenously
Enemies have set sequences of moves (perhaps some message like "skeleton roars"!" tells you what they're about to do)
Player begins each battle with X stamina
Player has main and off hand
Status effects (buffs/debuffs) are rare finds on rare weapons

Any:
	rest:
		gain stamina
		does nothing else

Fists (two-handed):
	attack:
		does small damage
		consumes normal stamina
		blockable
		parryable
	
Normal weapon (one-handed):
	attack:
		does normal damage
		consumes normal stamina
		blockable
		parryable

Shield (off-hand only):
	block:
		has a chance to stop incoming normal attack
		always blocks light attack
		never blocks heavy attack
		consumes normal stamina
		does no damage

Light weapon (one-handed):
	light attack:
		does small damage
		consumes small stamina
		blockable
		parryable
		stunned targets take extra damage

Two light weapons:
	parry:
		does no damage
		consumes normal stamina
		if enemy does NOT attack, does literally nothing lul
		if enemy does attack, stops all damage + stun enemy for a turn

Heavy weapon (two-handed):
	heavy attack:
		takes an extra turn to charge (where you do nothing)
		does BIG damage
		takes normal stamina
		not blockable
		parryable during charging turn
	bash:
		does small damage
		also blocks

Player stats:
	attack power
	health
	max stamina
	
Attack: [-|-|-|-|-]
Attack: [*|*|-|-|-]
