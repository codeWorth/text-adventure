Updates for 12/21/2021
Bugs:

-text does not update when taking the rusty sword from the skele

General Tasks:
-center the entire terminal window (not sure if this is easy to do or hard)
-when going into a new room, create a divider and then scroll the previous screen's info up so that it looks as if there is a new screen
    -go into a new screen when battling, same as the new room screen except scoll down each battle turn
    -when the player goes to the inventory, also create a divider screen like the new room and battle screen

In battle screen
