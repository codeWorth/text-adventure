Updates for 12/21/2021
Bugs:
-the large iron key does not disappear from inventory after opening the locked door
-text does not update when taking the rusty sword from the skele

General Tasks:
-center the entire terminal window (not sure if this is easy to do or hard)
-when going into a new room, create a divider and then scroll the previous screen's info up so that it looks as if there is a new screen
    -go into a new screen when battling, same as the new room screen except scoll down each battle turn
    -when the player goes to the inventory, also create a divider screen like the new room and battle screen
-make using too much stamina more friendly
    -right now, if you try to do an attack and you don't have enough stamina, it simply fails
    -the enemy still gets to attack
    -perhaps it shouldn't waste the turn, and instead warn the player that they don't have enough stamina

In battle screen
-get rid of the "Name:" text (done)
-Move the enemy text above the player text
